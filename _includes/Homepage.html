    <h1>Hello and welcome to my digital refuge.</h1>
    <h2>What?</h2>
    <p>
      Digital gardening is what people are calling non-linear, imperfect, iterative, less-marketing-y personal web spaces. Think about the meaning of the words: a site is singular, point like and dimension-less. A space has dimension, it may expand or shrink, change shape - as such it may convey character. A spacious garden on the web. That sounds much more appealing to me than a streamlined personal-branding blog.
